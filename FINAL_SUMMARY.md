# BotSight Implementation - Final Summary

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the BotSight backend features as requested.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Auto-detect new AI agents via a user-agent DB and keep snippets/config updated
- Created [agents table](server/db/ddl/01_create_tables.sql) with pattern matching
- Implemented [agent sync job](server/src/jobs/agentSyncJob.ts) to fetch remote agents.json
- Added unknown agent candidate tracking for review
- Created [seed data](server/scripts/seed.ts) with initial agents (GPTBot, PerplexityBot, etc.)

### 2. Site-owner analytics (which agents visited, what they extracted)
- Created [visits table](server/db/ddl/01_create_tables.sql) to track agent visits
- Created [extracted_fields table](server/db/ddl/01_create_tables.sql) to store extracted metadata
- Implemented [telemetry endpoint](server/src/routes/telemetry.ts) to capture visit data
- Created [analytics queries](ANALYTICS_QUERIES.md) for insights
- Added [unknown_agent_candidates table](server/db/ddl/01_create_tables.sql) for new agent detection

### 3. Dashboard Simulation (`/v1/simulate`) — Playwright worker
- Created [simulations table](server/db/ddl/01_create_tables.sql) to track simulation jobs
- Implemented [simulate endpoint](server/src/routes/simulate.ts) to enqueue jobs
- Created [Playwright worker](server/src/workers/simulateWorker.ts) to process simulations
- Added screenshot capture and storage
- Implemented proper user agent simulation

## 🔧 Key Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- Created all required tables with proper relationships and indexes
- Added appropriate data types (JSONB for structured data)
- Included timestamps for auditing

### API Endpoints
- **POST /v1/telemetry**: Processes snippet data, matches agents, stores visits
- **GET /v1/config/:siteId**: Returns site configuration
- **POST /v1/simulate**: Enqueues simulation jobs

### Client-side Snippet
- Implemented as an IIFE for easy embedding
- Uses `navigator.sendBeacon` for reliable data transmission
- Extracts structured data (JSON-LD, OpenGraph, etc.)
- Respects privacy by not sending sensitive data

### Simulation Worker
- Uses Playwright for accurate browser simulation
- Supports different user agents for accurate testing
- Extracts visible JSON-LD, meta tags, and content
- Takes screenshots for visual verification
- Handles errors gracefully

### Agent Sync Job
- Fetches remote agents.json file
- Upserts agent data to keep database current
- Can be scheduled to run periodically

## 🧪 Testing
- Created unit tests for telemetry endpoint
- Created unit tests for simulation worker
- Provided test scenarios in documentation

## 📊 Analytics
- Created example SQL queries for insights
- Covered agent detection, visit trends, and simulation results
- Included queries for monitoring system health

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy
- URLs normalized to strip query strings and fragments
- No PII stored except hashed IP addresses (optional)
- CORS properly configured
- llms.txt respected for agent disallow rules

## 🚀 Deployment Ready
- Complete setup guide with step-by-step instructions
- Environment variable configuration
- Database migration scripts
- CLI tools for common operations
- Production considerations documented

## 📚 Documentation
- Server README with setup instructions
- Implementation summary
- Setup guide
- Analytics queries
- This final summary

## 🎯 Requirements Fulfillment

All requirements from the original specification have been implemented:

1. ✅ `POST /v1/telemetry` accepts minimal payload from the snippet, stores row in `visits`, maps UA → `agents.id` when matched, and inserts `extracted_fields` rows.
2. ✅ Unknown UAs are upserted into `unknown_agent_candidates` for review.
3. ✅ `GET /v1/config/:siteId` returns site config used by snippets.
4. ✅ `POST /v1/simulate` enqueues a Playwright job and produces a `simulations` row with `status=done` and `result` JSON + `screenshot_url`.
5. ✅ Snippet (IIFE) logic updated to fetch config, compute extractedSummary client-side, and call `/v1/telemetry` via sendBeacon or fetch fallback.
6. ✅ There is a cron/worker job to fetch remote `agents.json` and upsert into `agents`.
7. ✅ Proper tests: demo insert + telemetry call → visit row exists + simulation run produces expected result.

The implementation follows best practices for production deployment, including:
- Parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection
- Proper error handling
- Transactional database operations
- Modular, maintainable code structure
- Comprehensive documentation
- Security and privacy considerations
